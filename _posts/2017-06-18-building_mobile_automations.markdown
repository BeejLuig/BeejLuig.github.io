title:  "Building Mobile Automations"

For a long time, I have held a particular fascination with automation, particularly with mobile devices. We carry these little supercomputers in our pockets, why not use them to solve every-day problems for us?  My favorite part of using automation apps is that we don't need to wait around for someone else to create solutions; we can do it ourselves! Even with a basic understanding of low-level programming concepts, we can create some powerful automations with little to no coding skills.

In this post, I want to share some of my favorite creations using the android app [Automate](http://llamalab.com/automate/). Automate has a flowchart interface for building practical and beautiful automations. Each block in the flowchart represents a trigger or action. If you are an android user looking to get into creating automations, I highly recommend this app. The documentation is fantastic, and if you don't know where to start, this is a vast community of users who share their creations.

Below are some of my best Automate projects, with brief descriptions and flowchart images.
